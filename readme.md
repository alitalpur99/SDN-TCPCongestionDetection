## TCP Congestion Detection in Software-Define Networks using Machine Learning

Idea of this thesis is to detect congestion in SDN networks using decision tree algorithms

### Tools used


1. POX OpenFlow controller (Highly recommend to use Ryu Python based controller with OF ver 1.3 or 1.5).
2. Mininet Emulator
3. Wireshark
4. Iperf ver. 3
5. Bash scripting for GNU plot
6. WEKA machine learning tool to train and test different decision tree algorithms 
7. Customized Linux Kernel
